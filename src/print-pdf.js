 * Send a PDF to a printer, whatever the machine is.
 *
 * pdf-to-printer bundles SumatraPDF-3.4.6-32.exe and has no platform branch of
 * its own - it is a Windows library wearing a cross-platform name. Calling it
 * on macOS or Linux fails, because there is no .exe to run.
 *
 * hardware-manager.js already knew that and used CUPS off Windows. kot-manager
 * did not: it called printPdf directly, so on a Mac or a Linux till every
 * kitchen ticket that fell back to PDF printing failed - caught and reported,
 * so nothing crashed and nothing printed. The build targets those platforms
 * (build:mac, build:linux), so that was a real hole rather than a theoretical
 * one.
 *
 * The fix is one function rather than the same branch written twice. This
 * codebase has already paid for the alternative: a helper that existed as five
 * copies, where each fix only ever landed in whichever copy bit that week.
 *
 * SumatraPDF is signed along with everything else in the Windows build. It is
 * third-party software we redistribute, and Windows checks the signature of
 * what actually runs - an unsigned helper launched by a signed application
 * still trips SmartScreen on a locked-down till.
